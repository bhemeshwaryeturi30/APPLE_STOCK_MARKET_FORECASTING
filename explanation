Absolutely — here is the metadata extraction for this entire deleted-scripts / CF-STS workflow, formatted exactly the same way as your previous accepted format ✅

(Only persistent Snowflake objects included — temporary CTEs excluded)

✅ What is Included vs Excluded

Category	Status
Columns used in SELECT / CASE / WHERE / GROUP BY ✅	Included
Temporary CTE tables ❌	NOT included
Derived columns / aliases ❌	Not metadata
Multiple UNION/table references ✅	Included once only

✅ Confirmation / Next Step

We now have five separate Snowflake script-extractions completed.
Before I consolidate anything further — please choose ⬇️:

A — Merge all Snowflake metadata into one master sheet
B — Keep Snowflake scripts separate (current approach)
C — Generate CSV downloads by environment
  (Snowflake / IDW / RXCOE_PMI)

You can just reply:

A or B or C

⸻

Once you choose, I can immediately deliver:

✅ Master metadata catalog
✅ Script lineage mapping (tables → attributes → business logic)
✅ Optionally, a visual ER / Data Lineage Diagram (if you want)

Which option would you like?
