✅ Decision Needed

How do you want the final output?

A — Merge all Snowflake metadata into one consolidated glossary
B — Keep separate script sections (as we are doing)
C — Provide separate downloadable CSV files:
  • Snowflake_Metadata.csv
  • IDW_Metadata.csv
  • RXCOE_PMI_Metadata.csv

Just reply with: A, B, or C ✅

(If helpful, I can additionally build:
✔ Table lineage diagram
✔ Field usage frequency report
✔ Script → source mapping tracker)

Which option would you like?
