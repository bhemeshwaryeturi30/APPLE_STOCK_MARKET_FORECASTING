Here’s your concise, executive-style README for the QT Exception Management script, following the same structure as your earlier request:

QT Exception Management – Primary Key Logic for Triage Queue Analytics

Purpose

This script builds a unified dataset for exception management analytics by assigning a consistent Store–Rx–Fill composite key to every triage queue instance. It enables operational and executive reporting across exceptions that may span different systems (queue, fill, outreach, and action notes).

Key Features
	•	Hierarchical Linking Methods:
	1.	Direct key from triage queue (QT)
	2.	Fill-reference via Prescription Fill Interface (PFI)
	3.	Outbound Communication linkage (OBD)
	4.	Action Note linkage (AN)
	•	Primary Key Generation using COALESCE priority logic
	•	Triage Classification (group, type, detail)
	•	Fiscal Quarter Integration for reporting cadence
	•	Performance Filters using 12-month recency criteria

Output Table

DL_RX_OPERATION.RPHAI_DS_SANDBOX.QT_EXCEPTION_MANAGEMENT_SP
	•	Grain: One row per triage exception
	•	Primary Key: FINAL_KEY (STORE-RX-FILL)
	•	Coverage: ~95%+ linkage success expected
	•	Scope: Fiscal Quarter 20252 (Q2 FY25)

Inputs
	•	CORE_RX.CURATED_SCRIPT.TRIAGE_QUEUE
	•	CORE_RX.CURATED_SCRIPT.PRESCRIPTION_FILL_XREF
	•	CORE_RX.CURATED_OUTREACH.RXC_OUTBOUND_CONTACT
	•	CORE_RX.CURATED_SCRIPT.RXC_ACTION_NOTE
	•	DL_RX_OPERATION.RX_OPS_SANDBOX.REF_QT_TRIAGE_ITEM_DESC_SP
	•	CORE_FSSC.CURATED_CALENDAR.FISCAL_QUARTER

Analytical Use Cases
	•	Exception resolution time and backlog trends
	•	Process bottleneck and workflow efficiency evaluation
	•	Clinical vs operational issue segmentation
	•	Executive reporting for triage volume and resolution patterns

Notes
	•	Uses COALESCE to retain highest quality key
	•	Distinct logic avoids duplicate join inflation
	•	Fiscal filter ensures quarter-specific dataset for business alignment
