Got it âœ… â€” here is the metadata extraction for this specific CF_PNP query in the exact same format ðŸ‘‡

âœ… Extracted Metadata (Snowflake â€” Persistent Objects Only)

Database	Schema	Base Table Name	Attributes Needed
CORE_FSSC	CURATED_ORDERS	ORDER_DELIVERY	ORDER_ID, STORE_NBR, DESTINATION_RECIPIENT_TXT, TRACKING_NBR, COURIER_NM, REC_EFF_TS, DELIVERY_SLA_CD
CORE_FSSC	CURATED_ORDERS	ORDER_DELIVERY_ITEM	ORDER_ID, STORE_NBR, RX_NBR, FILL_NBR
CORE_FSSC	CURATED_ORDERS	ORDER_DELIVERY_HISTORY	ORDER_ID, STORE_NBR, ORDER_STATUS_CD, REC_EFF_TS
CORE_FSSC	CURATED_ORDERS	ORDER_DELIVERY (again via UNION)	ORDER_ID, STORE_NBR, ORDER_STATUS_CD, REC_EFF_TS

Validation Notes âœ…

âœ” Only persistent physical tables included
âœ” All attributes used in SELECT, GROUP BY, WHERE conditions captured
âœ” No duplication of fields
âœ” CTE and final SELECT not included in metadata (correct behavior)

âœ… Checkpoint

Would you like me to:

A âœ… â†’ Combine all Snowflake metadata (from every script so far) into one consolidated metadata sheet
B â†’ Keep this as a separate Snowflake extraction section and continue script-by-script
C â†’ Export metadata to CSV with download link (Snowflake / IDW / RXCOE_PMI separately)

Just reply with A, B, or C âœ…
