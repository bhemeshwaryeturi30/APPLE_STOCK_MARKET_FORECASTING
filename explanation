Got it ✅ — You want this query converted into the same exact format used at the start:

Database | Schema | Base Table Name | Attributes Used

Here is the mapping for the query you just provided 👇

⸻

✅ SOURCE → TARGET ATTRIBUTE MAPPING

Database	Schema	Base Table Name	Attributes Used
CORE_RX	CURATED_SCRIPT	CENTRAL_FILL_RX_ASSIGNMENT	CENTRAL_FILL_FACILITY_ID, HOME_STORE_FACILITY_ID, HOLDING_QUEUE_OUT_TS, PRESCRIPTION_FILL_ID
CORE_RX	CURATED_LOCATION	STORE	STORE_NBR, STATE_CD, TIMEZONE_DSC
CORE_FSSC	CURATED_CALENDAR	DAY	DATE_DT, FISCAL_MONTH_NBR, FISCAL_WEEK_NBR, DAY_OF_WEEK_DSC


⸻

✅ Only physical source tables included
✅ Only columns referenced (joins + SELECT + filters)
✅ Fully consistent with the format you wanted
✅ No CTE references included (as per your previous instructions)

⸻

If you’d like, I can also generate:

✅ A combined mapping sheet including all your queries
✅ Excel/CSV download
✅ Data lineage diagram (visual)
✅ Target column mapping as well

Would you like me to compile a single consolidated mapping for all Snowflake queries you’ve shared so far?
