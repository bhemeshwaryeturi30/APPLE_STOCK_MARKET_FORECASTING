Central Fill Pick and Pack (CF_PNP) Delivery Tracking Analysis

This SQL script analyzes Central Fill (CF) prescription deliveries to monitor end-to-end order movement from the CF facility to the destination (home) store. It leverages order delivery and status data from the CORE_FSSC.CURATED_ORDERS schema to capture key timestamps such as order creation, handoff to courier, delivery completion, and cancellations over the past 12 months.

The logic begins by building a Common Table Expression (CTE) named CF_PNP, which consolidates data from multiple order-related tables — ORDER_DELIVERY, ORDER_DELIVERY_ITEM, and ORDER_DELIVERY_HISTORY. These sources are combined to ensure that both active and historical records are included. The query filters only relevant order status codes:
	•	10 → Order Created
	•	13 → Handoff to Courier
	•	4 → Delivered
	•	8 → Cancelled

For each prescription (RX_NBR, FILL_NBR, STORE_NBR), the script extracts the latest timestamps for each of these key events. It also associates each Central Fill record with its home store number, tracking number, and courier name to enable delivery performance measurement.

The primary filter ensures inclusion of only CF-to-store (CF-STS) deliveries (DELIVERY_SLA_CD = 'CF-STS'), with records from the past 365 days. Results are grouped by prescription and store identifiers to produce one row per fill.

In the final SELECT statement, the query outputs key attributes — CF_STORE_NBR, HOME_STORE_NBR, RX_NBR, FILL_NBR, TRACKING_NBR, COURIER_NM, ORDER_DATE, HANDOFF_DATE, and DELIVERED_DATE. Cancelled deliveries are excluded (Cancelled_Date IS NULL) to focus on successful or in-progress orders.

This dataset enables analysis of the Central Fill pick-and-pack process, providing insights into:
	•	Delivery cycle times between CF and home stores
	•	Courier performance and handoff timing
	•	Fulfillment efficiency and order completion trends

It serves as a foundational dataset for operational dashboards that monitor CF logistics and identify delays or inefficiencies in the delivery pipeline.
