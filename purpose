Developer & Wave Bypass Rates Report

This SQL process calculates Developer (DEV) and Wave Bypass activity rates across CVS stores, providing weekly insights into verification workflow compliance. It captures activity trends over the last 13 weeks (93 days) and aggregates data by store, district, region, and area.

⸻

Overview

The process extracts prescription fill activity data to measure how often verification steps are bypassed versus completed. It helps monitor workflow adherence, identify high bypass rates, and improve verification quality across the chain.

⸻

Data Sources
	•	CORE_RX.CURATED_SCRIPT.PRESCRIPTION_FILL
	•	CORE_RX.CURATED_SCRIPT.PRESCRIPTION_FILL_ACTIVITY
	•	SEM_RX.COMMON_RX.SEM_STORE
	•	CORE_FSSC.CURATED_CALENDAR.DAY

⸻

Logic Summary
	•	Filters data for last 93 days and fills with status codes (6,7,9) — Waiting Bin, Sold, or Returned to Stock.
	•	Focuses on activity codes:
	•	40 → DEV
	•	101 → DEV_BYPASS
	•	109 → WAVE
	•	111 → WAVE_BYPASS
	•	Creates a composite QV1_BYPASS flag for combined DEV & WAVE bypasses.
	•	Aggregates distinct prescription fills by store and fiscal week.
