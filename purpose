Here’s a concise README.md file in your preferred simple paragraph format (based on the template you used earlier) describing the SQL logic visible in your uploaded image:

Central Fill Holding Queue Out Analysis

This SQL script analyzes prescription fill records to monitor queue movement activity in the Central Fill (CF) process. It retrieves data from the CORE_RX.CURATED_SCRIPT.CENTRAL_FILL_RX_ASSIGNMENT and CORE_FSSC.CURATED_CALENDAR.DAY tables to identify when prescriptions are exiting the holding queue and adjusts timestamps based on store time zones for accurate reporting.

The logic begins by selecting relevant fields such as the Central Fill Facility ID, Store Number, State Code, Time Zone, Fiscal Week and Month Numbers, Day of the Week, and Hour of the Holding Queue Out Timestamp. It counts the total prescriptions that exited the holding queue (PRESCRIPTION_FILL_ID) and adds a record timestamp (UPDATE_DATE) representing the current date.

To ensure time consistency, the query adjusts timestamps differently based on the store’s time zone:
	•	For Central time, one hour is subtracted.
	•	For Mountain and Mountain AZ, two hours are subtracted.
	•	For Pacific, three hours are subtracted.
These adjustments are performed using the TIMESTAMPADD function.

The adjusted timestamps are then matched with the fiscal calendar (CORE_FSSC.CURATED_CALENDAR.DAY) to derive fiscal week and month context. Finally, results are aggregated by store, time zone, and hour of the holding queue out timestamp, with filters applied to consider only recent fiscal weeks (e.g., FISCAL_WEEK_NBR >= 202418).

This dataset provides insights into hourly queue out volumes, helping operations teams identify when prescriptions are most frequently leaving the holding queue and optimize workload distribution across time zones.

Would you like me to add a brief “Use Case and Output Summary” section at the end (like in your previous READMEs)? It can describe what metrics or dashboards this query supports.
